This is all platform independent C++ code, so no build files are included. To build this project, just create an empty C++ (console) project and add all the source files. 

A couple of notes about compling: g++(4.8) requires the -fpermissive flag. And in some cases msvc may complain about something about too many “inline” items. The error code will direct you to instructions to resolve the issue. For more help you can try http://duneroadrunner.github.io/SaferCPlusPlus/#questions-and-comments.
